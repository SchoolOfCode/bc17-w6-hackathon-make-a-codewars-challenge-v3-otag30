# Virtual Pet Simulator

Welcome to the Virtual Pet Simulator challenge! In this project, your goal is to create and manage a virtual pet by balancing its core attributes: hunger, happiness, and energy.
Users will interact with the pet by choosing from three different actionsâ€”Feeding, Playing, and Resting.
Each action will affect the pet's attributes in specific ways, and your challenge is to ensure the pet stays healthy and happy through balanced care.
