/*Virtual Pet Simulator 
Challenge:
Create a virtual pet that users can interact with. The pet should have attributes like hunger, happiness, and energy. 
Users can perform actions such as feeding, playing, and resting with the pet, which will affect these attributes. 
The challenge is to keep the pet happy and healthy by balancing its needs.

Interactions within the scope of the problem (basic MVP):
Feeding the pet decreases hunger and increases energy.
Playing with the pet increases happiness but decreases energy.
Resting increases energy but increases hunger.

example:
petCare("rest", "energy", "hunger) should return: Energy ⬆️ + Hunger ⬆️ */
export function petCare(userAction, petReaction1, petReaction2) {}
