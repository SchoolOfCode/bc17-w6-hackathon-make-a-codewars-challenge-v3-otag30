/**
 * Hello challenger! Your task is to write a function named `transformLength` which takes in a string and returns 1 if the length of the string is even and otherwise -1.
 *
 * Your implementation should handle strings whose length is between 0 (inclusive) and 2500 (inclusive).
 *
 * A few examples:
 *    `transformLength("table")` should return -1 as the length of "table" is not even
 *    `transformLength("wizard")` should return 1 as the length of "wizard" is even
 */
export function transformLength(string) {
  // Good luck!
}

/*Virtual Pet Simulator 
Challenge:
Create a virtual pet that users can interact with. The pet should have attributes like hunger, happiness, and energy. 
Users can perform actions such as feeding, playing, and resting with the pet, which will affect these attributes. 
The challenge is to keep the pet happy and healthy by balancing its needs.

Example Interactions:

Feeding the pet decreases hunger and increases energy.
Playing with the pet increases happiness but decreases energy.
Resting increases energy but might slightly increase hunger.

Objective:
Write unit tests to validate that the pet’s attributes change correctly based on the actions taken. 
Ensure that the pet’s status updates as expected and that it behaves consistently under various conditions. 
Implementation should handle unexpected input */
